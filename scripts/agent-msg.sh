# agent-msg.sh -- reliable inter-agent message send for the Marveen fleet.
#
# WHY: the common `curl -s ... >/dev/null && echo sent` pattern is DANGEROUS -- curl exits 0 even when
# the server REJECTED the request (401/400/5xx), producing a SILENT send failure: the recipient never
# gets the message and two agents can wait on each other forever. The /api/messages router itself is
# fine (HTTP 200 + a message id); the bug is that the SENDER never checks the result. This helper checks
# the HTTP status AND the returned message id, and RETRIES on failure. A message counts as sent only
# when an id came back.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/agent-msg.sh <from> <to> "<content>"
#   content: plain text (quotes / newlines OK) -- the body is built with json.dumps (no quoting pitfalls).
#   large / multi-line content may come from STDIN when the 3rd arg is "-":
#     echo "<long text>" | bash scripts/agent-msg.sh <from> <to> -
# Output: success -> "OK id=<n>"; failure -> "FAIL <reason>" + a line in store/agent-msg-failures.log, exit 1.
#
# LOG FORMAT, store/agent-msg-failures.log (tab-separated, one line per failure):
#   <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>  FAIL  from=<a>  to=<b>  url=<endpoint>  http=<code>  resp=<first 200 bytes>
# CHANGED 2026-09: the `url=` field is NEW. It was added together with the
# env-overridable base URL, because from that point a failure can mean "posted to
# the wrong address" and the old line could not distinguish that from a dead
# server. A parser written against the pre-2026-09 format sees one extra field;
# parse by the `key=` names, not by position.
# Env:
#   MARVEEN_API_BASE   full base URL, e.g. https://marveen.example.com (overrides host+port)
#   MARVEEN_WEB_PORT   port for the default localhost base (default 3420)
#   MARVEEN_TOKEN_FILE bearer token file (default <repo>/store/.dashboard-token)
# MEASURED 2026-09-13: a remote agent runs this helper OUTSIDE this repo, where localhost:3420
# does not exist -- it had to fall back to raw curl, i.e. exactly the unchecked pattern this file was
# written to eliminate. A hardcoded base URL silently un-installs the helper for everyone not on this
# VM, so the base is env-overridable and the two endpoints stay ONE script.
