# Git force-push guard

Marveen agents run autonomously, often with shell access and the ability to push
to git, so a prompt-injected or simply mistaken agent can rewrite shared history.
This guard reduces that blast radius without changing how the fleet works.

## What it does

`scripts/install-git-guard-hook.sh` installs a `pre-push` hook that **refuses a
non-fast-forward (force / rebase / amend) push to `main` or `master`**. Normal
fast-forwards and merge commits pass untouched, and every other ref (`develop`,
feature branches, fork branches, including `--force-with-lease` to those) is
unaffected: only history rewrites of a protected branch are blocked.

It is named `install-*-hook.sh`, so `scripts/sync-hooks.sh` (and the dashboard
update flow) run it automatically. It composes with an existing `pre-push` hook
(e.g. a secret scanner) by moving it under `.git/hooks/pre-push.d/` and adding a
small dispatcher that feeds the ref list to every sub-hook.

```bash
scripts/install-git-guard-hook.sh   # runs automatically on update; manual run also works
```

Override an intentional rewrite of a protected branch:

```bash
ALLOW_FORCE_PUSH=1 git push ...
```

# Bash egress deny rules

`scripts/hooks/egress-gate.mjs` compares a URL against the allowlist, but it is
wired as a `PreToolUse` hook with matcher `WebFetch` **only**. Bash was never
ungated (`outgoing-copy-gate.py` and `email-approval-gate.py` on the main agent,
`email-send-gate.mjs` and `self-pace-gate.mjs` on sub-agents) but none of those
gates looks at the destination host, so a shell `curl` never met the allowlist.
The realistic threat is not a malicious agent: it is a fetched page telling an
agent to run a `curl`, which is why the quarantine-reader exists in the first
place.

## What it does

`BASH_EGRESS_DENY` in `src/web/agent-scaffold.ts` is the single source of truth
for a small `permissions.deny` list that lands in **every** agent's
`settings.json`:

- on spawn, via `writeAgentSettingsFromProfile()`,
- on server startup, via `ensureBashEgressDeny()` (existing fleet, main agent
  included),
- on scaffold, via `templates/settings.json.template` (so the next agent created
  starts gated -- a parity test keeps the template and the constant in step).

Denied: `curl` to an `https://` URL, and `wget` / `nc` / `ncat` / `telnet`
outright. A `deny` rule is checked **before** the
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` bypass, so it binds on permissive profiles too.
Sanctioned tooling that speaks HTTPS on its own account (`git`, `gh`, `npm`) is
deliberately untouched: denying it would break the release path without closing
anything an agent could not do through it anyway.

The sanctioned route for external content is unchanged: the quarantine-reader
sub-agent, through `WebFetch`, where the domain check already runs. A host being
on the egress allowlist does not open it to the shell.

## Limits, stated out loud

This is a deny list, not a sandbox.

- **The localhost exception is why only `https://` is denied for `curl`.** The
  rule language has no negation and `deny` always beats `allow`, so "any
  `http://` host except localhost" cannot be expressed. A `*http://*` rule would
  also match `http://localhost:3420/...` and mute the whole fleet (memory,
  kanban, message queue, approvals all ride that URL).
- Still open, by construction: plain-http external fetches, an interpreter
  one-liner (`python3 -c`, `node -e`), and a URL hidden in a shell variable.
  Closing those needs a Bash `PreToolUse` hook that parses the command.
- Known collateral: an internal POST whose **double-quoted** payload quotes an
  `https://` URL matches the `curl` rule. Single-quoted payloads do not (the
  permission engine excludes single-quoted content). Use single quotes or
  `-d @file` for such a call.
